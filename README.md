M1 Project - Glutton Free Dog - Game

Description of the Game:

It was a fun way to honor my faithful four-legged friend. My dog ​​eats everything without discrimination. That was my main idea of ​​joining the word "Glutton" with the word "Gluten" as an analogy to gluten intolerance, that is now so referred to in our society.
In this sense, the objective of the game is for the dog to take only gluten-free food (in this case dog food and the essential water), avoiding three of the many examples of existing gluten-free foods (baguette, pizza, beer).

I hope you have fun as I had fun creating the idea and showing a little bit of my personality (Sense of humor and animal lover).

MVP:

- The game has one dog that can move around the canvas to the left and right and horizontally way;
- The food with and without gluten will fall down indiscriminately;
- The food without gluten will increase 10 points on your score;
- The food with gluten will intoxicate the dog and you will lose score;
- When you get too many foods with gluten the dog will be intoxicated and it will be Game over for you.
- For winning the game you have to collect as many food without gluten as you can.
